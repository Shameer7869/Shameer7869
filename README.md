- I design and build web applications with a strong emphasis on structure,
intentional decision-making, and long-term maintainability. I’m interested
not just in *making things work*, but in understanding *why* they work and
how they can evolve over time.

### AI & My Direction
- I actively use AI as a development and reasoning tool—from accelerating
problem exploration to refining implementation decisions. I’ve worked
with AI-assisted workflows and see artificial intelligence as a long-term
collaborator in building better software, not just faster code.
